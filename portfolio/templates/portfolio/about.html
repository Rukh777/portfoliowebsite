      <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Rukhsar Khan, I'm a Full-stack Developer and Travel Photographer.</p>
      <p>Travel is the best kind of education so go get lost, even if itâ€™s just outside your own doorstep! My Aim to tell stories through images and to encourage others to find joy exploring this beautiful world while respecting the nature around them.</p>
      <p>Photography became a great excuse to look deeper and to make my experiences more intense.
      My main goal as a photographer is to create the kinds of images which combine a strong sense of story and convey what it felt like to be with the people I met in the places I visited.</p>
